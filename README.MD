React DOM (^18.0.0)
Refine (@refinedev/core@^4.48.0) - for data management and filtering
Recharts (^2.1.9) - for chart creation
dateformat (^5.0.3) - for date formatting
Additional dependencies listed in package.json
Installation
Clone or download this repository.

Install dependencies using npm or yarn:

Bash
npm install
Use code with caution.
Usage
Import the Dashboard component from the appropriate file (e.g., index.js):

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Dashboard />
    </div>
  );
}
Use code with caution.
Refine Configuration
This component assumes you have configured Refine to manage your data resources named dailyRevenue, dailyOrders, and newCustomers. You'll likely need to modify the useList hooks within the component to match your specific resource names and configurations within Refine.

Code Breakdown
We'll explore the code incrementally, focusing on key functionalities:

Imports:

The component imports necessary libraries like React, Refine hooks (useList), useState, useMemo, and chart components from ResponsiveLineChart.
Initial State:

The useState hook defines an array (filters) to hold filter criteria for the data. It includes start and end date filters by default.
Fetching Data:

Three useList hooks fetch data from Refine resources (dailyRevenue, dailyOrders, and newCustomers) based on the applied filters.
Memoized Chart Data:

The useMemoizedChartData function takes daily customer and order data and combines them while ensuring proper date formatting and sorting.
Tabs and Content:

A tabs object defines the chart to be displayed, with its label and content (ResponsiveLineChart component with combined data and colors).
Filter Inputs:

The component conditionally renders date pickers (input type="date") to allow users to adjust the start and end date filters. It updates the filters state on input changes.
Conditional Rendering:

The component conditionally renders chart sections and legends based on data loading status and filter expansion state.
Additional Notes
This is a basic example, and you might need to customize it for your specific data and requirements.
Consider adding comments within the code to explain complex logic or data manipulation.
